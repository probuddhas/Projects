##1) Image Watermarking using Bisection Technique<br>
Basically a project on Information Hiding. Here we take an image as a carrier image & a secret binary/bitmap image. Our objective is to embed that secret bitmap image into our carrier image such that the sole existence of the secret embedded image can not detected by any intermediate viewer viewing the image.
